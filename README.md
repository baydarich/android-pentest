# Android pentest

This repo is aimed at helping android pentesters and appsec engineers to set up the testing environment from scratch more quickly. It also contains some useful info and scripts.

## Setting up the environment

1. Install Android Studio, emulator and add adb to path env var before continuing.
2. Put your burp certificate into `burp-cert` folder and name it `burp-cert.der`.
3. Run the emulator.
```
cd ~/Android/Sdk/emulator
./emulator -writable-system -selinux disabled -avd <your_avd_name>
```
4. Go to project folder and run `configure.sh` to configure the emulator.
```
sh configure.sh
```
5. (Optional) Set up frida.
```
cd frida
sh frida.sh
```
6. (Optional) Bypass ssl pinning with frida.
```
frida -U -f [APP_ID] -l frida_multiple_unpinning.js --no-pause
```
7. Configure your avd to use burp proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)
8. Run the command below to communicate with proxy.
```
adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080
```
